I had a previous knowledge from studying and working in React, java script and html.

In this exercise we needed to use Django and i had never used it. 
I was looking for guides in Google, and i found a few videos in this channel in Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/TraversyMedia/videos
that helped me understand what's Django and how can i use it.
Eventually, i know how to write backend from previous projects so it's pretty similar, but it was interesting to learn about Django.

Tutorial: VS Code

Installations: 
  React - I was mostly helped by this site: https://react-bootstrap.github.io/
  Django - https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/intro/tutorial01/
